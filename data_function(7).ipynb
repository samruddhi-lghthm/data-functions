        "#A Generator in Python is a function that returns an iterator using the Yield keyword.\n",
        "#In this article, we will discuss how the generator function works in Python.\n",

        "#Generator Function in Python\n",
        "#A generator function in Python is defined like a normal function, but whenever\n",
        "#it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return.\n",
        "#If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a Python generator function.\n",
        "# A Python program to demonstrate use of\n",
        "# generator object with next()\n",
        "\n",
        "#One of the powerful features of generators is their natural compatibility with iteration.\n",
        "#You can use generators to create custom iterators for data structures or data streams.\n",
        "#In this example, fibonacciSequence is a generator function that generates an infinite Fibonacci sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Regular functions run to completion, executing all statements in one go. Generator functions\n",
        "#can pause their execution with the yield keyword and later resume from where they left off, allowing for cooperative multitasking.\n",
        "#Memory efficiency: Generator functions only evaluate the code that is needed, which can make them more memory efficient than regular functions.\n",
        "#Lazy loading: Generator functions can be used to lazy load data, which means that the data is not loaded until it is actually needed.\n",
        "#This can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.\n",
        "#Flexibility: Generator functions offer a more flexible approach to computation than regular functions.\n",
        "#This can make them a valuable tool for a variety of tasks.\n",
        "#Infinite Sequences: Generator functions make it easy to create infinite sequences by allowing pausing and resuming.\n",
        "#This is ideal for real-time data processing where data is constantly arriving.\n",
